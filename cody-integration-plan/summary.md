# :cody Integration Plan Summary

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive plan outlines the implementation of OpenCode commands that expose the full :cody framework workflow through OpenCode's command system. The solution provides specialized subagents for different workflow types, automatic context detection, and seamless integration with the existing opencode-config project structure.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Core OpenCode Commands (10 commands)
- `/plan` - Project planning and discovery
- `/build` - Build phase initiation  
- `/version add` - Version creation
- `/version build` - Version building
- `/refresh` - Context refresh
- `/relearn` - Project relearning
- `/upgrade` - Framework upgrades
- `/assets-list` - Asset inventory
- `/help` - Documentation
- `/refresh-update` - State management

### 2. Specialized Subagents (5 agents)
- **cody-planner** - Read-only planning and analysis
- **cody-builder** - Full development access
- **cody-version-manager** - Version-specific workflows
- **cody-admin** - System administration
- **cody-general** - Information and guidance

### 3. Integration Components
- Automatic :cody project detection
- Context preservation across commands
- Template integration with existing opencode-config
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimization

## Technical Architecture

### Command Structure
- OpenCode markdown command format with YAML frontmatter
- Template variable support (`$ARGUMENTS`, `@file`, `!command`)
- Subagent assignment and configuration
- Model selection optimization

### Agent Configuration
- Mode-based permissions (primary/subagent)
- Tool-specific access control
- Temperature and model optimization
- Workflow coordination capabilities

### Integration Strategy
- Seamless integration with existing opencode-config templates
- Backward compatibility with current configurations
- Modular design for easy maintenance
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Milestones 1-3)
- Core command structure implementation
- Basic subagent configurations
- Context detection system
- Initial error handling

### Phase 2: Integration (Milestones 4-6)

- Advanced context management
- Template integration
- Enhanced error handling

### Phase 3: Validation (Milestones 7-8)
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Performance optimization
- Documentation completion
- User acceptance testing

## Testing Strategy

### Multi-Level Testing
1. **Unit Tests** - Individual components (90%+ coverage)
2. **Integration Tests** - Command-agent coordination (80%+ coverage)
3. **End-to-End Tests** - Complete user scenarios

### Validation Criteria
- Command structure compliance
- Agent permission validation
- :cody workflow compatibility
- Performance benchmarks
- User experience validation

## Benefits

### For Users

- 5 specialized subagents with appropriate permissions
- 100% compatibility with existing :cody workflows
- Integration with all opencode-config templates

### Performance Metrics
- Command execution < 2 seconds
- Agent switching < 1 second
- Context detection < 3 seconds
- Error response < 1 second

### Quality Metrics
- 90%+ unit test coverage
- 80%+ integration test coverage
- Zero critical bugs in release
- Positive user acceptance testing results

## Next Steps

1. **Planning Review** - Validate all planning documents with stakeholders
2. **Environment Setup** - Prepare development and testing environments
3. **Phase 1 Implementation** - Begin core command and subagent development
4. **Iterative Development** - Follow milestone-based approach with continuous testing
5. **Documentation** - Maintain comprehensive documentation throughout development

## Conclusion

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for integrating :cody framework workflows into OpenCode's command system. The modular architecture, specialized subagents, and comprehensive testing strategy ensure a robust, maintainable solution that enhances both the opencode-config project and the broader OpenCode ecosystem.

The phased approach allows for iterative development and validation, while the detailed technical specifications provide clear guidance for implementation. The result will be a seamless integration that maintains the full power of :cody while leveraging OpenCode's advanced agent and command infrastructure.
