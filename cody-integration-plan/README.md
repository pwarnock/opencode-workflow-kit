# OpenCode :cody Integration Plan

## Overview

This comprehensive plan outlines the implementation of OpenCode commands that expose the full :cody framework workflow through OpenCode's command system. The integration enables users to execute :cody workflows using OpenCode's agent infrastructure with specialized subagents.

## Planning Documents

### Core Planning
- **[Discovery](discovery.md)** - Initial requirements gathering and project understanding
- **[PRD](prd.md)** - Product requirements document with detailed specifications
- **[Plan](plan.md)** - Implementation plan with technical architecture and milestones

### Technical Analysis
- **[Commands Analysis](commands-analysis.md)** - Detailed analysis of all :cody commands to be implemented
- **[Subagent Configuration](subagent-configuration.md)** - Specialized subagent designs for different workflow types
- **[Implementation Approach](implementation-approach.md)** - Detailed implementation strategy and technical approach
- **[Testing Strategy](testing-strategy.md)** - Comprehensive testing and validation strategy

## Key Features

### Core :cody Commands
- `/plan` - Start planning phase with interactive discovery
- `/build` - Initiate build phase and feature backlog creation
- `/version add` - Create new versions with feature definitions
- `/version build` - Build specific versions
- `/refresh` - Refresh project context and memory
- `/relearn` - Complete project relearning
- `/upgrade` - Framework upgrade management
- `/assets-list` - Project asset inventory
- `/help` - Documentation and guidance

### Specialized Subagents
- **cody-planner** - Read-only planning and analysis
- **cody-builder** - Full development access for implementation
- **cody-version-manager** - Version-specific workflow management
- **cody-admin** - System administration and upgrades
- **cody-general** - Information and guidance

### Integration Features
- Automatic :cody project detection
- Context preservation across commands
- Graceful error handling for missing :cody
- Seamless integration with existing opencode-config templates

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Commands (Milestone 1-3)
- Implement basic command structure
- Create essential subagents
- Add context detection
- Basic error handling

### Phase 2: Advanced Integration (Milestone 4-6)
- Complete command suite
- Enhanced context management
- Template integration
- Advanced error handling

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Milestone 7-8)
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Performance optimization
- Documentation completion
- User acceptance testing

## Integration with opencode-config

### Template Updates
- **Minimal Template**: Basic :cody commands
- **Development Templates**: Full :cody integration
- **New :cody Template**: Specialized for :cody workflows

### Configuration Structure
```
config/
├── global/
│   ├── agents/          # :cody subagents
│   └── commands/        # :cody commands
└── project/
    └── .opencode/
        ├── agents/       # Project-specific agents
        └── commands/     # Project-specific commands
```

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Levels
1. **Unit Testing** - Individual command and agent components
2. **Integration Testing** - Command-agent and :cody workflow compatibility
3. **End-to-End Testing** - Complete user scenarios

### Validation Criteria
- Command structure compliance
- Agent permission configuration
- :cody workflow compatibility
- Performance benchmarks
- User experience validation

## Usage Examples

### Starting a New Project
```bash
# Initialize OpenCode project
opencode
/init

# Start :cody planning phase
/plan MyProject

# Follow interactive discovery process
# Create planning documents

# Start build phase
/build

# Add versions
/version add 1.0.0 initial-release
/version build 1.0.0-initial-release
```

### Working with Existing :cody Project
```bash
# Navigate to existing :cody project
cd existing-cody-project

# Refresh context
/refresh

# Continue workflow
/build
/version add 1.1.0 feature-updates
```

## Error Handling

### Missing :cody Installation
```
Error: :cody framework not found
Install: https://cody.dev/install
Or use: /help for alternative workflows
```

### Invalid Project Structure
```
Error: Invalid :cody project structure
Missing: discovery.md in plan phase
Run: /relearn to rebuild project context
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Targets
- Command execution: < 2 seconds
- Agent switching: < 1 second
- Context detection: < 3 seconds
- Error response: < 1 second

### Resource Management
- Efficient template loading
- Context caching
- Memory usage optimization
- Cleanup for failed operations

## Next Steps

1. **Review Planning Documents** - Validate requirements and approach
2. **Environment Setup** - Prepare development and testing environment
3. **Phase 1 Implementation** - Start with core commands and basic subagents
4. **Iterative Development** - Follow milestone-based development approach
5. **Continuous Testing** - Test at each phase with comprehensive validation

## Contributing

This plan serves as the foundation for implementing the :cody integration feature. Contributors should:

1. Review all planning documents before implementation
2. Follow the phased approach outlined in the implementation plan
3. Adhere to the testing strategy and validation criteria
4. Update documentation as features are implemented
5. Maintain compatibility with existing opencode-config structure
