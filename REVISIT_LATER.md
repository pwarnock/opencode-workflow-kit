# TODO: Revisit Default Configuration & Onboarding

## Priority: HIGH

### Issues to Address:

1. **Simplify Default/Onboarding Flow**
   - Current opt-in process is too complex
   - Need streamlined activation
   - Consider user experience for non-technical users

2. **Configuration Schema Mismatch**
   - `opencode.json` schema doesn't support overrides
   - Need proper inheritance mechanism
   - Fix validation errors

3. **Global vs Project Scope**
   - Clarify when to use global vs project-level
   - Document trade-offs clearly
   - Provide migration paths

### Action Items:
- [ ] Simplify enable/disable process
- [ ] Fix schema validation for overrides
- [ ] Create better onboarding documentation
- [ ] Add CLI commands for management
- [ ] Consider auto-detection of API keys

### Target Date: Next development cycle
