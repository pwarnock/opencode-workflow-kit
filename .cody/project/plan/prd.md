# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
This document formalizes the idea and defines the what and the why of the product the USER is building.

## Section Explanations
| Section           | Overview |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Summary           | Sets the high-level context for the product. |
| Goals             | Articulates the product's purpose — core to the "why". |
| Target Users      | Clarifies the audience, essential for shaping features and priorities. |
| Key Features      | Describes what needs to be built to meet the goals — part of the "what". |
| Success Criteria  | Defines what outcomes validate the goals. |
| Out of Scope      | Prevents scope creep and sets boundaries. |
| User Stories      | High-level stories keep focus on user needs (why) and guide what to build. |
| Assumptions       | Makes the context and unknowns explicit — essential for product clarity. |
| Dependencies      | Identifies blockers and critical integrations — valuable for planning dependencies and realism. |

## Summary
A shareable collection of opencode configurations that enables developers to maintain consistent setups across multiple machines and projects with simple installation and cross-platform compatibility.

## Goals
- Eliminate repetitive configuration recreation for developers working across multiple environments
- Provide a centralized, version-controlled repository for opencode configurations
- Enable both global and project-specific configuration deployment
- Create a foundation for community sharing and iteration of configuration best practices

## Target Users
Opencode users who work across multiple machines and projects, particularly individual developers who need consistent development environments without manual recreation of settings.

## Key Features
- Cross-platform configuration files for agent settings, MCP configurations, and permissions
- Simple README-based installation instructions for manual setup
- Support for environment-specific configurations via env files
- Version-controlled configuration repository on GitHub
- Modular structure supporting both global (~/.config/opencode) and project-level deployment

## Success Criteria
- Primary: Configurations are successfully installed and used on multiple machines
- Secondary: Other opencode users discover, adopt, and contribute to the configuration collection
- Reduced setup time for new machines and projects
- Consistent behavior across different development environments

## Out of Scope (Optional)
- Automated installation scripts or package management (v1.0)
- Configuration management GUI or web interface
- Advanced configuration validation or conflict resolution
- Integration with package managers (npm, pip, etc.)
- Multi-user team collaboration features

## User Stories (Optional)
- As a developer working on multiple machines, I want to install my opencode configurations once and have them work consistently across all my environments
- As a developer starting a new project, I want to quickly apply my preferred opencode settings without manually recreating them
- As a developer, I want to maintain my configurations in version control so I can track changes and rollback if needed
- As a developer, I want to share my configurations with others so they can benefit from my setup

## Assumptions
- Opencode uses a standardized configuration structure at ~/.config/opencode
- Users are comfortable with manual file copying and basic command-line operations
- Configurations are primarily text-based files that can be version controlled
- Cross-platform compatibility can be achieved through careful file structure design
- Users have git installed for cloning the repository

## Dependencies
- Git for repository management and cloning
- Standard file system access for copying configurations
- Opencode application following standard configuration directory conventions
- Basic command-line tools for file operations (cp, mkdir, etc.)
