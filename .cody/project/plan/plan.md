## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a shareable opencode configuration collection that enables developers to maintain consistent setups across multiple machines and projects. The solution focuses on simplicity with manual installation via README instructions and version-controlled configuration files.

## Architecture
The solution follows a simple file-based architecture:
- **Repository Structure**: A Git repository containing configuration files organized by category (agent, mcp, permissions, etc.)
- **Installation Method**: Manual file copying with clear README instructions
- **Configuration Scope**: Support for both global (~/.config/opencode) and project-level deployment
- **Platform Support**: Cross-platform compatibility through careful file organization and naming conventions

## Components
- **Configuration Files**: Core opencode configuration files (agent settings, MCP configs, permissions)
- **README Documentation**: Installation instructions and usage guidelines
- **Environment Files**: Template environment files for customization
- **Directory Structure**: Organized layout separating different types of configurations
- **Version Control**: Git repository for tracking changes and enabling collaboration

## Data Model
- **Configuration Files**: Text-based configuration files (JSON, YAML, TOML, etc.)
- **Environment Templates**: Template files with placeholder values for customization
- **Documentation**: Markdown files for installation and usage instructions
- **Directory Structure**: Hierarchical organization by configuration type and scope

## Major Technical Steps
1. **Repository Setup**: Initialize Git repository with basic directory structure
2. **Configuration Collection**: Gather and organize existing opencode configurations
3. **Documentation Creation**: Write comprehensive README with installation instructions
4. **Environment Template Creation**: Create template files for customization
5. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Verify configurations work across different operating systems
6. **Version Control Setup**: Establish proper git workflow and release strategy

## Tools & Services
- **Git**: Version control and repository management
- **GitHub**: Repository hosting and collaboration platform
- **Markdown**: Documentation format for README and instructions
- **Standard File Tools**: cp, mkdir, ln for manual installation operations
- **Text Editors**: For editing configuration files and documentation

## Risks & Unknowns
- **Opencode Configuration Changes**: Risk of opencode changing configuration structure or locations
- **Platform-Specific Issues**: Potential differences in file paths or permissions across operating systems
- **Configuration Conflicts**: Risk of conflicts when users have existing configurations
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Ongoing effort needed to keep configurations updated with opencode changes
- **User Error**: Potential for users to misconfigure during manual installation

## Milestones
- **Milestone 1**: Repository setup with basic structure and initial configuration files
- **Milestone 2**: Complete README documentation with installation instructions
- **Milestone 3**: Environment templates and customization examples
- **Milestone 4**: Cross-platform testing and validation
- **Milestone 5**: Initial release and deployment to multiple machines

## Environment Setup
- **Prerequisites**: Git installation, basic command-line familiarity
- **Repository Access**: Ability to clone GitHub repository
- **File Permissions**: Sufficient permissions to modify ~/.config/opencode directory
- **Text Editor**: For reviewing and modifying configuration files
- **Opencode Installation**: Working opencode installation for testing configurations
