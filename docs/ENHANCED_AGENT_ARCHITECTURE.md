# Enhanced Agent Architecture

This document describes the enhanced agent architecture with specialized subagents for complete software development lifecycle management.

## Architecture Overview

The enhanced architecture provides clear separation of concerns, delegation patterns, and checks and balances for robust software development and deployment.

## Agent Roles and Responsibilities

### Executive Level

#### cody-admin (System Administrator)
- **Role**: Flight Director / System Authority
- **Primary Responsibilities**:
  - Production system ownership and safety
  - Final authority for deployment decisions
  - Delegates release operations to cody-release-manager
  - Delegates security validation to security-subagent
  - System maintenance and operations
- **Final Authority**: Production deployment "Go/No-Go"

### Management Level

#### cody-version-manager (Scope & Planning)
- **Role**: Mission Planning
- **Primary Responsibilities**:
  - Version scope definition and management
  - Feature backlog allocation to versions
  - Release scope validation
  - Version lifecycle management
  - Scope change management

#### cody-release-manager (Release Operations)
- **Role**: Release Director
- **Reports to**: cody-admin (delegated authority)
- **Primary Responsibilities**:
  - Release pipeline coordination
  - Release readiness validation
  - Delegates quality validation to qa-subagent
  - Coordinates security validation with security-subagent
  - Release process execution and monitoring

### Specialized Subagents

#### cody-builder (Integration & Implementation)
- **Role**: Vehicle Engineering
- **Primary Responsibilities**:
  - Code implementation and integration
  - Build automation and system integration
  - Testing implementation
  - Workflow automation
  - Deployment preparation (not execution)

#### qa-subagent (Quality Assurance)
- **Role**: Quality Control
- **Reports to**: cody-release-manager (for release validation)
- **Also serves**: cody-builder (during development)
- **Primary Responsibilities**:
  - Test strategy and execution
  - Quality gate enforcement
  - Performance and integration testing
  - Quality standards validation

#### security-subagent (Security Assurance)
- **Role**: Safety Officer
- **Reports to**: cody-admin (for production security)
- **Also serves**: cody-release-manager (for release security)
- **Primary Responsibilities**:
  - Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
  - Compliance validation
  - Security architecture review
  - Security clearance for releases

#### technical-writer (Documentation)
- **Role**: Documentation Specialist
- **Primary Responsibilities**:
  - Documentation creation and maintenance
  - User guides and tutorials
  - API documentation
  - Release notes and changelogs

## Delegation Patterns

### Release Delegation Chain
```
cody-admin (System Authority)
    ↓ delegates release operations
cody-release-manager (Release Operations)
    ↓ delegates quality validation
qa-subagent (Quality Assurance)
    ↓ coordinates security validation
security-subagent (Security Assurance)
```

### Feature Development Chain
```
cody-version-manager (Scope Definition)
    ↓ allocates features to version
cody-builder (Implementation)
    ↓ delegates documentation
technical-writer (Documentation)
```

## Release Governance

### Quality Gates
1. **cody-builder**: Implementation complete
2. **qa-subagent**: Quality standards met
3. **security-subagent**: Security requirements met
4. **cody-release-manager**: Release readiness confirmed
5. **cody-admin**: Production deployment approved

### Checks and Balances
- **qa-subagent** can block releases for quality issues
- **security-subagent** can block releases for security concerns
- **cody-release-manager** can halt releases for process issues
- **cody-admin** has final authority based on system safety

### Escalation Paths
- Quality issues → qa-subagent → cody-release-manager → cody-admin
- Security issues → security-subagent → cody-admin (direct)
- Process issues → cody-release-manager → cody-admin
- Scope issues → cody-version-manager → cody-release-manager

## Communication Protocols

### Standard Delegation Format
```
@target-agent perform-operation --context="..." --requirements="..."
```

### Status Reporting
- All subagents provide status updates to their reporting manager
- Critical issues escalate immediately up the chain
- Regular coordination meetings between managers

### Decision Authority
- **Operational decisions**: Made by responsible subagent
- **Strategic decisions**: Made by managing agent
- **Final authority**: cody-admin for production systems

## Implementation Requirements

### Configuration Files
Each subagent requires:
- Agent configuration JSON file
- Capability definitions
- Delegation pattern specifications
- Permission matrix entries

### Integration Points
- MCP server configurations for specialized tools
- Permission matrix updates for new agents
- Delegation pattern implementations
- Communication protocol definitions

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for each agent's core functionality
- Integration tests for delegation patterns
- End-to-end tests for release governance
- Security validation tests
