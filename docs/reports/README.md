# Project Reports

This directory contains various project reports, implementation summaries, and planning documents that have been moved from the project root to maintain a cleaner workspace.

## Report Categories

### Implementation Reports
- Various `_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` files documenting completed work
- `_SUMMARY.md` files providing project summaries

### Planning Documents
- `_PLAN.md` files for project planning phases
- Documentation improvement plans and strategies

### Quick References
- Quick reference guides for CI/CD, automation, and other workflows
- Technical documentation for specific features

### Release Management
- Release notes and version-specific documentation
- Migration guides and implementation summaries

## Organization

Files are organized alphabetically for easy navigation. When adding new reports to this directory, please follow the existing naming conventions:

- Use descriptive filenames with clear prefixes
- Include version numbers when applicable
- Use `.md` extension for all report files

## Git Configuration

The project's `.gitignore` file has been configured to prevent report files from being created in the root directory. Report files matching patterns like `*_REPORT.md`, `_PLAN.md`, etc. should be placed directly in this directory to maintain a clean project structure.
