## Executive Summary

This plan addresses critical documentation gaps in the opencode-config project to improve user adoption, reduce support burden, and establish the project as the definitive resource for OpenCode configuration management. The plan prioritizes high-impact documentation that serves both end-users and contributors.

### Current State Analysis

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive README with installation and basic usage
- Good coverage of configuration structure and usage patterns
- Excellent testing documentation and validation procedures
- Strong :cody integration documentation

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
1. **OpenCode Core Documentation** - Missing reference docs for commands, tools, models, themes, keybinds, formatters, rules, custom tools
2. **Project-Specific Guides** - Missing migration guide, template development, integration testing, schema reference, troubleshooting
3. **Advanced Topics** - Missing enterprise setup, CI/CD integration, security best practices, performance optimization
